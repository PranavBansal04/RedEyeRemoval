# RedEyeRemoval

This short project is for detecting and removing red eyes from an image using simple python code. The source code with comments is attached. I had to try out a lot of different values of rgb for detecting a red pixel to come up with the beset results. The initial and final images have also been uploaded. Have Fun!
